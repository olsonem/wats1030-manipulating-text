The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programing Enviroment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Event though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative porgrams and techniques, no
single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to
programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philisophy can't be written 
down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from
the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs
do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and 
useful tools.
