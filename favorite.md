# My Favorite Text editor

I am partial to **nano** mostly for ease of use.  I caught on to it quickly, and liked that so many of the shortcuts
were listed on the bottom of the screen. I feel like I can go back into nano without really needing resources
to navigate my way through files or make required edits.  It is a bit clunky to have to exit the program to 
get into your next file, but that also simplify things in a way.

It surprised me how much I liked **vi.**  I thought that having to indicate when you were editing vs when you were
in the command line would slow me down, but I actually found it quite pleasing. I had to look up commands more 
frequently in vi, but was a fan of navigating with the search function, something I found lacking in nano.

**Emacs** was my least favorite.  I didn't like that I had to execute dual commands to access many of the functions
I am however very impressed with the ability to play [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris).
